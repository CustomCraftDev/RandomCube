I quickly made a plugin for everyone, that wants to see how the cube gets build via random generator.

Pluginlink: https://github.com/CustomCraftDev/RandomCube/raw/master/RandomCube.jar
Source: https://github.com/CustomCraftDev/RandomCube

how to use:
  - remove old world
  - in server.properties change these two:
     generator-settings=2;0;1
     level-type=FLAT
  - download and install plugin
  - start up server and teleport:
     /tp @a 0 50 0
  - change gamemode to creative or spectator (fly mode)
  - drop any item to start / pause / resume the generation

have fun ^^
